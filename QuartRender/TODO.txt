ABSTRACT:
	A somewhat comprehensive document outlining things that need to be done to further the project.


IMPORTANT:
	-add a logging class and object in utilsGL.h that can receive strings as "lines" of
		the logging and save them. Make sure each line contains information of where the logging
		call was made! This should replace the LOG_TO_CONSOLE family of macros in usage and would
		serve as a debugging tool mostly that should be disabled for release builds. Note: I am still
		allowed to use macros, ill just make them better hopefully.
	-add the infrastructure to pass camara orientation to shaders to calcuate phong lighting.
	-add a settings class and object that saves all useful constants per program instance.
		(e.g, z-plane default distance for all 3d objects)
	-add a meters to normalized coordinates converter so it is possible to express coordinates for objects
		in meters relative to the centre of the solar system.
